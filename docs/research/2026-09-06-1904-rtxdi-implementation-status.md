# RTXDI implementation status

Owner approval: 2026-09-06, "zaczynaj".
Approved plan commit: `e02ea8c87dbad71ca5db85cbba605c47e9825477`.
Implementation task baseline: `33b555c7f225afd1e586bf749f2b485c1de260df`.
Plan: [RTXDI replacement](../plans/2026-09-06-1854-rtxdi-renderer-plan.md).

## Current stage

Step 1 landed in `89b35e1d1c287bc3e68ac289c2aede7363f08dc3`; its fresh hostile
review returned PASS on 2026-09-06. Step 2 landed in
`ee7ae4e52888eba32b1e2b62c93cb64bab4aebaa`; its fresh review is in progress.
Step 3 implementation is active. Steps 3–7 have not landed. No RTXDI frame
dispatch or rendered image is claimed.

Step 1 evidence: pinned importer completed 159 NRD SPIR-V tasks; a temporary
native GLSL reservoir/random-sampler closure passed glslangValidator Vulkan 1.2.
This did not cover the later complete RAB/DI passes. SCons built 15 imported
host translation units and linked the editor/console executables with
`platform=windows target=editor accesskit=no d3d12=no -j16`. The disabled optional
SDKs were missing on this machine. These are compile/link results, not GPU proof.

The independent review verified pinned upstream files and the recorded RTXDI
patch, all 159 embedded SPIR-V variants and their binding offsets, and all 15
host objects in the linked archive. It found no defects within Step 1's scope.
Full DI shaders, template and real-device dispatch remain later-stage gates.

Step 2 evidence (2026-09-06): the same Windows Vulkan editor build command
completed and linked both binaries after initialization, ownership and API
replacement. Six changed XML files parsed successfully; staged diff check passed.
This does not prove startup failure behavior or GPU rendering. The excluded owner
file `rt_test_scenes/capture.gd:28,30,31` still references removed PT properties;
it was not migrated. Step 7 uses a new owned demonstration project.

Intermediate builds/rendering may fail by explicit owner authorization. Final
completion requires the plan's real-device rendering gate. Automated tests are
not authorized. Preserve the owner's untracked demo/game content.

## Available validation environment

Read-only device/tool discovery on 2026-09-06 via local `vulkaninfoSDK.exe` and
PowerShell: RTX 4090, NVIDIA driver 616.64, device Vulkan 1.4.351, ray query and
acceleration structure features true, maxColorAttachments 8. These feature values
do not prove shader-format compatibility or correct renderer execution.

SCons, Python 3.14, VS18 BuildTools CMake/Ninja and Vulkan SDK 1.4.357.0
glslangValidator are available. No Godot process was running at inspection.
Step 1 rebuilt the normal editor binaries, but they do not yet contain the later
RTXDI render passes. Other existing binaries remain pre-task artifacts.

## Boundaries

The approved plan's opaque standard-PBR milestone excludes DDGI, indirect
reflections, glass/thin-leaf transmission and the future geometry DAG/voxels.
Fog still requires its existing shadow maps. No backward compatibility or
non-RT gameplay fallback is to be added.
